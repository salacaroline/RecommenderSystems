Designers of these systems must define the possible customizations to be offered to users at design time. To do so, they have to decide what choices to make available to users, and consider which scenarios may be generated by users’ decisions and their impact over time in other users’ interactions. In this paper, we propose a modeling language that supports designers in this activity by allowing them to describe users’ choices and actions over time and their impacts. Based on this description a scenario generator describes the situations that users can create by their choices. Exploring the scenarios generated at design time, the designer can inspect if any of the scenarios represent undesirable situations for end users.

We are developing a distributed digital library for which services and interfaces include, for example, mobile agents for federated information retrieval, recommendation agents, 3D visualization aids, and access to digital documents that support specific courses and projects. The diversity of these interfaces, plus the volume and dynamism of the digital library?s underlying collections, result in a complexity that has the potential to make the digital library unwieldy for the user. In order to assist users in dealing with this complexity, we have designed environments, termed personal and group spaces, which provide users with means to access and control all available resources in a uniform fashion from a single vantage point.
