In particular, the growth in the\ndevelopment of open-source home automation applications\nbased on Internet of Things (IoT) controlled by mobile devices\npresents numerous opportunities to boost the development of\nsuch aids. However, there is little research into how accessible\nthe interfaces of such mobile applications are to people with\nvisual disabilities. This paper presents an evaluation of six\nopen-source mobile systems for home automation using IoT -\nDomoticz, Freedomotic, Home Assistant, HomeGenie, Mister\nHouse and openHAB. The evaluation was performed by means\nof expert review of accessibility guidelines using smartphones.\nThe results showed that all the applications evaluated had\naccessibility problems that could prevent visually disabled\nusers from using them, such as inaccessible controls, visiondependent\nfeatures, and lack of textual descriptions of images.\nThe paper points out important adjustments that need to be\ncarried out in order for IoT-based smart home applications to\nfully accomplish their potential of helping visually-disabled\nusers lead more independent lives at home.",

          "paper_abstract_EN" : "The development of solutions known as “smart homes” has\nbeen explored to provide accessible resources to aid in the\ndaily lives of disabled people. In particular, the growth in the\ndevelopment of open-source home automation applications\nbased on Internet of Things (IoT) controlled by mobile devices\npresents numerous opportunities to boost the development of\nsuch aids. However, there is little research into how accessible\nthe interfaces of such mobile applications are to people with\nvisual disabilities. This paper presents an evaluation of six\nopen-source mobile systems for home automation using IoT -\nDomoticz, Freedomotic, Home Assistant, HomeGenie, Mister\nHouse and openHAB. The evaluation was performed by means\nof expert review of accessibility guidelines using smartphones.\nThe results showed that all the applications evaluated had\naccessibility problems that could prevent visually disabled\nusers from using them, such as inaccessible controls, visiondependent\nfeatures, and lack of textual descriptions of images.\nThe paper points out important adjustments that need to be\ncarried out in order for IoT-based smart home applications to\nfully accomplish their potential of helping visually-disabled\nusers lead more independent lives at home.",

Having found problems in chart construction by novice users, we researched the following question: How can we support novice users to create efficient visualizations with statistical data? To address this question, this paper describes ViSC, a recommender system that supports the interactive construction of charts to visualize statistical data by offering a series of recommendations based on the selected data and on the user interaction with the tool. The system explores a visualization ontology to offer a set of graphs that help to answer information-based questions related to the current graph data. By traversing the recommended graphs through their related questions, the user implicitly acquires knowledge both on the domain and on visualization resources that better represent the domain concepts of interest. This paper also reports a qualitative study conducted to evaluate ViSC, using two methods: the Semiotic Inspection Method (SIM) and a Retrospective Communicability Evaluation (RCE) —a combination of the Communicability Evaluation Method (CEM) and Retrospective Think Aloud Protocol. We first analyze how the questions influence the users’ traversal through the graph and then address the broader question.

We identified three kinds of abilities that are necessary for a better learning and application of these methods: systematic interpretation, abstraction and wide perspective. We have also identified the relation among these three abilities. In the triangulation step of the research we found that these abilities are also recurrently invoked as necessary to the learning of other Computer Science subjects such as programming, induction, and object-oriented design and development. In conclusion, we suggest that strategies used to teach Semiotic Engineering methods can explicitly explore the connections with other contents in the Computer Science curriculum and thus begin to reap mutual benefits.",

          "paper_abstract_EN" : "This paper presents the results of an in-depth qualitative study carried out to investigate the teaching and learning of Semiotic Engineering methods, namely the Semiotic Inspection and the Communicability Evaluation methods. We identified three kinds of abilities that are necessary for a better learning and application of these methods: systematic interpretation, abstraction and wide perspective. We have also identified the relation among these three abilities. In the triangulation step of the research we found that these abilities are also recurrently invoked as necessary to the learning of other Computer Science subjects such as programming, induction, and object-oriented design and development. In conclusion, we suggest that strategies used to teach Semiotic Engineering methods can explicitly explore the connections with other contents in the Computer Science curriculum and thus begin to reap mutual benefits.",

In order to evaluate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of VAApps, we must pay special attention\nto the visual representations and their underlying interaction\nmechanisms. When designing visual representations, before\ninvesting time and other resources in conducting user evaluations,\nwe can apply analytical approaches to guide design\nand to establish a common ground within the development\nteam to compare and discuss design alternatives. In this paper,\nwe use two analytical approaches to evaluate our early implementation\nof HistoryViewer (HV), a user interaction history\nvisualization system. One approach uses the Physics of Notation\ntheory [12], analyzing the graphical notation itself whilst\ndocumenting some design choices based on the principles\nstated in the theory. The other approach is the Cognitive Dimensions\nof Notation framework [9], which is used to evaluate\nusability by considering cognitive characteristics of notations\nused in the design of interface and interactions of a system.\nWe compare the results of both studies in order to highlight\nthe similarities and differences in the findings.
