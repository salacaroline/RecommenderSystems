Therefore, it doesn't make sense to use the term as designers do. This paper takes the designers' phrases as a spontaneous expression of design intent and explores the correspondences between these and two of the phenomena captured by communicability evaluation: missing and declining affordances. It highlights some useful distinctions between levels of affordances, and hints at possible links between communicative and cognitive perspectives. It suggests that framing affordances within a broader communicative dimension, and taking advantage of the rhetoric that people use to describe what they are doing, can bring interesting insights to design.",   "keyword": "affordances" }

They say they will put affordances in the interface, or afford this or that to the users, but Norman points out that affordances only exist inasmuch as they are perceived by users. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to use the term as designers do. This paper takes the designers' phrases as a spontaneous expression of design intent and explores the correspondences between these and two of the phenomena captured by communicability evaluation: missing and declining affordances. It highlights some useful distinctions between levels of affordances, and hints at possible links between communicative and cognitive perspectives. It suggests that framing affordances within a broader communicative dimension, and taking advantage of the rhetoric that people use to describe what they are doing, can bring interesting insights to design.",   "keyword": "affordances" }

Such  a  review  provides  the  background  for  the  second  objective,  that  is,  the  presentation  of  the  theoretical  presuppositions  as  well  as  of  the  operationalization  stages  of  a  specific  qualitative  method  the  Underlying  Discourse  Unveiling  Method  –  UDUM.  This  method  was  conceived  in  clinical  psychology  with  the  purpose  of  giving  visibility  to  invisible  aspects  of  the  “inner  configuration”  of  contemporary  men,  women  and  children.  It  has  also  been  used  in  HCI  in  order  to  identify  users’  characteristics  which  are  of  great  interest  to  the  development  of  software  and  interfaces,  such  as  likes,  dislikes,  desires,  expectations,  difficulties,  etc.,  mainly  when  these  are  hard  to  verbalize  explicitly.  Finally,  as  a  suggestion  for  future  work,  an  eventual  and  still  under  study  quantitative  complementation  of  the  results  generated  by  UDUM  is  discussed.",   "keyword": "usuários" }

Therefore, it is interesting to think of providing tools which support teachers to deal with those challenges. Cognitor is an authoring tool that helps teachers to develop web based learning material, aiming to support teachers to develop learning content which can integrate learners from different culture background, during the learning process, and which can be easily understood, through the use of common sense knowledge, i.e. the knowledge shared by people inserted into the same cultural context. This paper presents a usability test on Cognitor and discusses some preliminary results from it, pointing to the relevance of the tool to help teachers with their tasks.",   "keyword": "patterns" }

The interface design patterns support the designer in employing proven solutions, for they represent a recurrent problem and its abstract solution in such a way that this solution can be applied to different instantiations of the same problem. PICAPs are structured in multiple layers to make possible the users  diversity accommodation. The layers are indexed by personas as user s characterization resource. This concept has been applied to electronic government services, because such systems should be usable by any citizen and therefore are a good example of the user diversity problem. A field research with 25 designers has been performed to check the concept´s applicability.",   "keyword": "personas" }

Data obtained with such surveys are translated to numerical scores to undergo statistical analysis, and are presented graphically in a number of different ways. When evaluating information visualization techniques, for comparison purposes it is often necessary to apply the same Likert-scale based questionnaire to different views or techniques. Most of the existing tools, however, do not support the simultaneous analysis of multiple Likert scale datasets. This paper presents an interactive visualization technique to help the analysis of Likert scale data obtained from several, alternative sources.

The main objective of the\nstrategy is to investigate the main questions of an\nentrepreneur about her product in beta version, trying to\nunderstand which factors are the most relevant to her postrelease\nactions. In the study case, data was collected and\nthere were evidences that the relations among user\nexperiences, marketing and technology affected user\nbehaviors. It was given some recommendation to orient the\nentrepreneur in her post-release actions.",   "keyword": "experiências de usuário" }

Consequently, the introduction of the culture concept in interactive systems is becoming a necessity, a challenge, and a timely and relevant issue. Indeed, culture has received increasing attention in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) community. In this survey we summarize some basic concepts like internationalization, localization, describing some culture models, particularly Hofstede s cultural dimensions. After we discuss how HCI practices could address these cultural dimensions. Our intention is to establish background and some basic concepts for helping designers incorporating cultural issues in their interaction design.",   "keyword": "localization" }

Often, five choices are posed to respondents (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and strongly disagree) for each statement. Data obtained with such surveys are translated to numerical scores to undergo statistical analysis, and are presented graphically in a number of different ways. When evaluating information visualization techniques, for comparison purposes it is often necessary to apply the same Likert-scale based questionnaire to different views or techniques. Most of the existing tools, however, do not support the simultaneous analysis of multiple Likert scale datasets. This paper presents an interactive visualization technique to help the analysis of Likert scale data obtained from several, alternative sources. The technique is based on a hybrid table and bar chart view, and provides different interactive tools to support data exploration. We describe the use of our tool in a case study where we compare different graph layouts.",   "keyword": "user interfaces" }

Vozze integrates three major concepts: multitactile surfaces, speech recognition, and workspaces that are dynamically created and linked to each other. Our main goal is to provide the advantages of using a technological platform in innovation processes while maintaining a natural interaction. Multi-tactile surfaces are based on simple hand gestures we have designed. Speech recognition addresses issues related with text entry on interactive surfaces, which typically relies on cumbersome virtual keyboards.

We found that third places within the studied community happen as serendipitous gatherings where personal and work stories are exchanged. These gatherings occur in unexpected places and are nomadic in nature, thus, the third place location is ?uid. NUIs and other ICTs can promote these gatherings by creating ?informational hubs? where people can come together to acquire, discuss and share information.",   "keyword": "third place" }

We focus on handling small sets of gestures (A,E,I,O,U) and (B,C,F,L,V), processing them in two steps: Segmentation and Classification. For the Segmentation we propose a Virtual Wall and Libras-specific heuristics to improve the hand tracking. For the classification we use a Multi-Layer Perceptron trained by the system and present an arm cutting algorithm that improved the recognition rate from 67.4% and 75.4% to 100% for both gesture sets. Finally, we evaluated the processing performance of the overall system and proof that it is able to process frames at 62.5Hz with an Intel i7 processor, which is more than twice as fast as the Kinect frame capturing rate.",   "keyword": "brazilian sign language" }

We performed an ethnographic study with a community of Brazilian health care professionals at a chronic care hospital. We observed that daily socializing, through constant playful conversation creates a sense of ?togetherness? that appears essential for problem solving and leads to more e?cient work groups. We found that third places within the studied community happen as serendipitous gatherings where personal and work stories are exchanged. These gatherings occur in unexpected places and are nomadic in nature, thus, the third place location is ?uid. NUIs and other ICTs can promote these gatherings by creating ?informational hubs? where people can come together to acquire, discuss and share information.",   "keyword": "natural user interfaces" }

Initially, we designed collaboration patterns in the collaborative multi-touch game PAR (Acronym in Portuguese for Ask, Help, Receive) based on the requirements of a group of Brazilian users with autism. In the empirical study of PAR, we identified the need to improve the characteristics of these collaboration patterns to facilitate gradually the adoption of collaborative mechanisms of the game by the users. We conduct, therefore, this qualitative study to inspect the intercultural experience promoted by PAR in light of Cultural Viewpoint Metaphors (CVM), a conceptual tool.

The study is part of a long-term research on self-expression through software programming. Savvy users creating mediation dialogs for the benefit of other users (third parties) are actually engaged in a human-computer interaction (HCI) design process involved in end user development (EUD). The study shows that decisions about when, where, how and why to go back to previous points in the design of mediated conversation with WNH are very complex, even for savvy users. More importantly, we collected powerful evidence of the participants interpretation of what interaction through WNH is all about. We believe that such evidence stands for their intuitions about HCI in a broader sense.

The goal of this paper was to compare these three methods in order to identify the differences in the results each of them generates. To do so, a case study applying each of the methods was performed. The problems identified with each method were then classified according to a set of criteria we have defined to this end.
