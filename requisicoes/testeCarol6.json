Among the many techniques available for data mining, identifying association rules is one of the most popular. The novel aspect of rule association mining systems brings new challenges to the HCI field. In this article, we identify these challenges and analyze them based on the theory of action, and characterize it within the semiotic engineering theoretical framework. Thus, we provide designers with an explanation of aspects to be considered during use and design of such systems. This theoretical based explanation contributes to a deeper understanding of the issues involved in interacting with association rules mining systems, allowing for better informed decisions during design process. It also motivates future empirical investigations.",

However, in the mobile domain, limited empirical evidence exists showing the interplay among these three constructs and the role culture plays.

Using path modeling, we investigated the relationships among the perceptions of these three HCI constructs and the possible differences that exist between the two cultures. Our results show: 1) it is the perception of aesthetics that predominantly drives the judgment of mobile web credibility at the global and subgroup levels, with the effect size being greater for the Canadian group than for the Nigerian group; 2) the direct effect of aesthetics on usability is moderated by culture, with the magnitude being stronger for the Nigerian group than for the Canadian group; and 3) our models explain 29-83% of the variance of credibility.",

Those mechanisms need to be carefully designed, but there are still no de facto standard design models to represent user-system interaction in a way that privileges decisions regarding the usability of the product being developed. Recently, we proposed USINN (USability-oriented INteraction and Navigation model) to express usability mechanisms in interaction and navigation modeling solutions. In this paper, we present an empirical study conducted in academic environment to investigate the use of USINN to represent usability mechanisms in interaction and navigation design solutions. The results indicated that the participants consider USINN to be easy to use and useful for the interaction and interface design. They also pointed out the need for a better knowledge about usability to apply USINN effectively.",

Our results show: 1) it is the perception of aesthetics that predominantly drives the judgment of mobile web credibility at the global and subgroup levels, with the effect size being greater for the Canadian group than for the Nigerian group; 2) the direct effect of aesthetics on usability is moderated by culture, with the magnitude being stronger for the Nigerian group than for the Canadian group; and 3) our models explain 29-83% of the variance of credibility.",

          "paper_abstract_EN" : "Visual analytics applications (VAApps) rely heavily on visual\nrepresentations and notations to communicate information and\nsupport user’s interaction. In order to evaluate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of VAApps, we must pay special attention\nto the visual representations and their underlying interaction\nmechanisms. When designing visual representations, before\ninvesting time and other resources in conducting user evaluations,\nwe can apply analytical approaches to guide design\nand to establish a common ground within the development\nteam to compare and discuss design alternatives. In this paper,\nwe use two analytical approaches to evaluate our early implementation\nof HistoryViewer (HV), a user interaction history\nvisualization system. One approach uses the Physics of Notation\ntheory [12], analyzing the graphical notation itself whilst\ndocumenting some design choices based on the principles\nstated in the theory. The other approach is the Cognitive Dimensions\nof Notation framework [9], which is used to evaluate\nusability by considering cognitive characteristics of notations\nused in the design of interface and interactions of a system.\nWe compare the results of both studies in order to highlight\nthe similarities and differences in the findings. We discuss\nhow each theory contributed to the analysis. We also provide\nsome guidance for the development team to use them in order\nto improve the final user interface solution.",

          "paper_abstract_EN" : "A large amount of information has been generated and manipulated in an increasing scale in recent years. One solution for viewing so much information was provided by large displays. However, with the increase of the screens came problems in the user-system interaction, where designers usually consider only the increase in screen space in such devices instead of changes in the user behavior interacting with each device. This paper investigates the interaction of users using different types of large displays while performing tasks in a 3D navigation system. In particular, we have focused on the user behavior when discussing with another participant while actively interacting with a tabletop computer or passively watching a wall display co-located in the same office space. This paper aims to show that the interaction with large displays can bring benefits to users, both for the use of 3D systems as for collaborative work.",
