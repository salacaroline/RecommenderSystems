We present the results of a systematic analysis contrasting their model of concurrent behavior with the corresponding programming interface messages that trigger their users’ interpretation and learning of concurrencyrelated concepts. We present and discuss the conceptualizations that potentially emerge from using these five tools and compare them with established concurrency concepts. Our findings indicate opportunities for an explicit exploration of how some concurrency aspects are implemented in games and simulations built with CT tools.

The goal was to obtain indicators of NCL usability in the generation of content for IDTV, since this language plays the role of interface language for users. Through data collected on forms filled by 220 students from various classes of training courses conducted in some states of Brazil and later analysis by a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, some aspects were found where the NCL profile can and should be improved in order to ease the activities of content creators for IDTV, who have a heterogeneous profile and are not necessarily familiar with computer programming.",

However, in the mobile domain, limited empirical evidence exists showing the interplay among these three constructs and the role culture plays. To address this, we carried out a survey on four systematically designed mobile websites among 233 subjects from Canada and Nigeria, which belong to low- and high-context cultures respectively. Using path modeling, we investigated the relationships among the perceptions of these three HCI constructs and the possible differences that exist between the two cultures. Our results show: 1) it is the perception of aesthetics that predominantly drives the judgment of mobile web credibility at the global and subgroup levels, with the effect size being greater for the Canadian group than for the Nigerian group; 2) the direct effect of aesthetics on usability is moderated by culture, with the magnitude being stronger for the Nigerian group than for the Canadian group; and 3) our models explain 29-83% of the variance of credibility.",

          "paper_abstract_EN" : "Multimodal Interactions have been used in many fields of application, such as medicine, manipulation of assistive technologies, interactions in public environments, among others. It is important to not only develop technologies (hardware and software) but to study and project optimization possibilities for the usage of these innovative interfaces as well. This work aims to identify which are the major problems when using head tracking interactions combined with voice commands, this being a multimodal interaction. This evaluation is focused in the lowest level of interaction, which are actions more physical and less cognitive, such as click, drag and drop, scroll a page, among others. Therefore, as consequence of this research, there were proposed some suggestions to improvement of interface projects that use this form of interaction.",

We identified three kinds of abilities that are necessary for a better learning and application of these methods: systematic interpretation, abstraction and wide perspective. We have also identified the relation among these three abilities. In the triangulation step of the research we found that these abilities are also recurrently invoked as necessary to the learning of other Computer Science subjects such as programming, induction, and object-oriented design and development. In conclusion, we suggest that strategies used to teach Semiotic Engineering methods can explicitly explore the connections with other contents in the Computer Science curriculum and thus begin to reap mutual benefits.",

Our results show: 1) it is the perception of aesthetics that predominantly drives the judgment of mobile web credibility at the global and subgroup levels, with the effect size being greater for the Canadian group than for the Nigerian group; 2) the direct effect of aesthetics on usability is moderated by culture, with the magnitude being stronger for the Nigerian group than for the Canadian group; and 3) our models explain 29-83% of the variance of credibility.",

          "paper_abstract_EN" : "This paper presents an empirical study about the Nested Context Language (NCL), which is a language developed to create multimedia documents and Interactive Digital TV (IDTV) applications for the Brazilian system. The goal was to obtain indicators of NCL usability in the generation of content for IDTV, since this language plays the role of interface language for users. Through data collected on forms filled by 220 students from various classes of training courses conducted in some states of Brazil and later analysis by a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, some aspects were found where the NCL profile can and should be improved in order to ease the activities of content creators for IDTV, who have a heterogeneous profile and are not necessarily familiar with computer programming.",

          "paper_abstract_EN" : "This paper presents an exploratory study about how savvy end users configure return points in mediated interactions with Web applications through WNH (Web Navigation Helper), a user agent that supports rephrasing, explanation, commentary and elaboration of interaction in scripted Web activities. The study is part of a long-term research on self-expression through software programming. Savvy users creating mediation dialogs for the benefit of other users (third parties) are actually engaged in a human-computer interaction (HCI) design process involved in end user development (EUD). The study shows that decisions about when, where, how and why to go back to previous points in the design of mediated conversation with WNH are very complex, even for savvy users. More importantly, we collected powerful evidence of the participants interpretation of what interaction through WNH is all about. We believe that such evidence stands for their intuitions about HCI in a broader sense. The main contribution of the study is thus to illuminate aspects of EUD and HCI that haven’t been discussed to-date and to propose questions for new kinds of investigation.",
