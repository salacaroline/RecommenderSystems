Our findings show that there is a significant\ndiscrepancy between users´ behavior in online and offline\nsocial networks, as well as strategies developed to deal with\nsome of the experienced issues.

The principles were proposed thinking about the context of children’s education. Previous studies suggest that the use of the principles results in software that children have rather positive responses when interacting with them. In this paper we explored the principles for Affectibility in a context outside children’s education. The principles were introduced to a group of prospective designers (undergraduate students), who had to create mobile applications for the World Cup. Students elicited the main concepts (using participatory techniques) for the new applications; and then developed and evaluated each other’s applications. The objective of this work is to evaluate the viability of the use of the principles outside educational contexts and to understand the use designers make of the principles.",    "keyword": "participatory design"  }

In order to validate this proposal, we conducted initial experiments with potential users, pediatric neurologists and physical therapists. The user experience was a success and the results indicate promising usability in the medical area.",    "keyword": "virtual reality"  }

For people with severe motor disabilities, gaze is one of the few alternatives to interact with the world. The most common gaze interaction paradigm is called dwell-time, where keys are selected using fixations longer than a certain “dwell”. Though simple, this mechanism does not permit the selection of keys at precise moments, a requirement to play music and certain video games. In this paper we introduce two gaze interaction techniques that overcome this limitation. The first is an extension of the dwell-time, where selection is triggered when the gaze exits the focused key. The second is based on the Context Switching paradigm, that uses saccades for selection instead offixations. Results of a user experiment show that the Context Switching paradigm permits a more accurate timing control while playing music at 45 and 70 beats per minute.",    "keyword": "accessibility"  }

As contributions, we highlight: 1) discussion of existing visualization mechanisms and their support on emergency management; 2) prototype of the Emergency Response Toolkit (ERTK), a set of tools to support command centres on using information from the crowd, e.g. in large-scale events; and 3) evaluation of ERTK and its visualization mechanisms with 11 emergency experts, in Brazil, Austria and Spain, collecting feedback to improve information visualization for emergency management.",    "keyword": "emergency management"  }

The literature has indicated that a cognitive authority produces and shares information of better quality and relevance for those who recognizes that authority, being a promising concept to support information retrieval and quality judgement on the web. However, identifying such authorities is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce the idAuthority: a conceptual framework to support the identification of cognitive authorities in social networks. To illustrate its application in a practical context, we instantiate the framework for a real online social network of Inclusive Education teachers, and evaluate its results with a group of six teachers.

However, as the 4th Grand Research Challenge for the Brazilian Computer Society mentions, it is necessary to extend computational systems to all Brazilians, respecting their diversity and differences. Most studies in the literature consider the participation of users with different profiles during the design process. However, there is not a concern with interface adaptation to user’s needs and interaction preferences. This paper presents a design process which guides the ubiquitous systems design from the relevant users’ features identification to adapt the user interface, to the evaluation of the created prototype. The user’s characteristics identification is performed by applying the UbiCARD technique in the system context to be developed. A prototype is presented as a proof of concept.",    "keyword": "user diversity"  }

We expect\nthis paper to provide directions for technical communicators\non writing texts that are more aligned with the fact that each\nperson has power to make a change on their own lives, and\nthat artifacts can be used as means for furthering these choices\nand enabling persons towards their own objectives.",    "keyword": "User-Centered Design"  }

From the analysis\nof 427 event-by-event logged sessions (captured under user\nconsent) of a technical reference website, this work presents\nhow to identify task deviations by using eccentricity\ndistribution. The proposed technique is a promising way of\nidentifying task deviations in large log data sets containing\ninformation about how users performed real tasks.",    "keyword": "accessibility"  }

The research was developed in an environment learning of Software Engineering and had the collaboration of students of the Department of Computer Science (DCC) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The main objective of the research is to verify the existence of productive bottlenecks in Software Development Process (SDP), typify them and if possible to promote treatments to solve the impacts in the process and in the software product. For this, three experimental rounds were carried out and three different domains were applied. Each round had deferential teams working in the same domain. The experiments also involved the Unified Process (UP) to guiding the SDP and the Theory of Constraints (TOC) to identify and treat the restrictive elements found in the productive process. As results, the work presents a set of qualitative constraints subdivided into two groups: (1) Behavioral Constraints (BC), and (2) Technical Constraints (TC). The identification of these qualitative constraints allowed quantitative bottlenecks to be detected. The research also showed that bottlenecks are associated with certain tasks performed in the software development environment within a given domain.

The research was developed in an environment learning of Software Engineering and had the collaboration of students of the Department of Computer Science (DCC) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The main objective of the research is to verify the existence of productive bottlenecks in Software Development Process (SDP), typify them and if possible to promote treatments to solve the impacts in the process and in the software product. For this, three experimental rounds were carried out and three different domains were applied. Each round had deferential teams working in the same domain. The experiments also involved the Unified Process (UP) to guiding the SDP and the Theory of Constraints (TOC) to identify and treat the restrictive elements found in the productive process. As results, the work presents a set of qualitative constraints subdivided into two groups: (1) Behavioral Constraints (BC), and (2) Technical Constraints (TC). The identification of these qualitative constraints allowed quantitative bottlenecks to be detected. The research also showed that bottlenecks are associated with certain tasks performed in the software development environment within a given domain. In general, these tasks are consuming resources, such as effort, time and human resources. This fact leads to the software product to a low quality due to the lack of completeness and correctness of the artifacts delivered to the end of the productive process.",    "keyword": "Quali-Quantitative Analysis"  }

To demonstrate this,\nwe draw on examples of ethnographic research into everyday\nearly morning routines where people deal with diverse\nmaterials, liquids, objects and surfaces as they prepare for the\nday ahead. Our findings show that mobile screen technology\nuse and experience is inextricable from morning routines and\nshaped by the messiness and creative improvisations these\nroutines involve. This, we argue, has implications for future\ntechnology design.",    "keyword": "Ethnographic Design"  }

Enthusiasm comes from their utilities in people\ndaily life, and concerns may be associated with privacy\nissues. By using two IoT systems as case-studies, we examine\nusers’ privacy beliefs, concerns and attitudes. We focus on\nfour major dimensions: the collection of personal data, the\ninference of new information, the exchange of information to\nthird parties, and the risk-utility trade-off posed by the features\nof the system. Altogether, 113 Brazilian individuals answered\na survey about such dimensions.

After, focusing on the human-computer interaction specialist\nperspective we examined the users’ facial expressions with\nthe aims of identifying which emotions they sensed during interactions\nwith each application. We gathered evidence that an overall\npositive user experience can be achieved even if the user had some\ninteraction issues.

In National High School Examination (ENEM),\nfor candidates to a vacancy in higher education institutions, the\nessay must be written in Portuguese, not taking into account the\nfirst language of the candidate. This paper presents an adapted\nframework that groups concepts of CoDesign, technology adoption,\nHCI life cycle and Semantic Numbers, and also shows the results of\nfirst phase of research. This phase consists of a contextual analysis\nof an Assistive Technology project for Portuguese teaching as a\nsecond language for VP. The adapted framework aims to reach\nobjectives, working with interested parts, to be accessible and potentially\nadopted by them. As results we have defined Interested\nParts Diagram, discussed responses applied surveys and elaborated\nPersonas. Also, it was possible to observe the relation of the PV\nwith the Portuguese, their wishes and difficulties with ENEM.",    "keyword": "Semantic Numbers"  }
